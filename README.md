# language_practice_oneliner
A oneliner in python which lets you improve your vocabulary in different languages.

This repo is specifically for a python program that will allow you to learn vocabulary lessons (and make new ones) in one line of python code.
The maximum amount of characters is 255 (spaces included), just like the oneliners from the commodore 64 era.
The goal is to make this program as user-friendly and feature-packed as possible within the 255-character limit.
